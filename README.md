# BANKING_SYSTEM_OOP_-PYTHON-
BANKING SYSTEM USING PYTHOON OOPS CONCEPTS 

a simple banking application that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and view their account balance. The parent class, user, holds basic information about the user, such as their name, age, and gender. The child class, bank, inherits from the user class and adds additional functionality for banking, such as depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account balance.

To use the application, you create a new instance of the bank class and pass in the user's name, age, and gender. You can then call the deposit(), withdraw(), and view_balance() methods to manage the user's account.

The code is well-written and easy to understand. It is also modular, meaning that it is easy to add new features or functionality in the future.
